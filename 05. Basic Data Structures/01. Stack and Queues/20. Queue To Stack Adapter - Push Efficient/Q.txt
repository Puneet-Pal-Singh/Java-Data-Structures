Queue To Stack Adapter - Push Efficient
Question
  1. You are required to complete the code of our QueueToStackAdapter class. 
2. As data members you've two queues available - mainQ and helperQ. mainQ is to contain data and helperQ is to assist in operations. (This is cryptic - take hint from video)
2. Here is the list of functions that you are supposed to complete
2.1. push -> Should accept new data in LIFO manner
2.2. pop -> Should remove and return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print "Stack underflow" and return -1.
2.3. top -> Should return data in LIFO manner. If not available, print "Stack underflow" and return -1.
2.4. size -> Should return the number of elements available in the stack
3. Input and Output is managed for you.

Note -> push and size should work in constant time. pop and top should work in linear time.
