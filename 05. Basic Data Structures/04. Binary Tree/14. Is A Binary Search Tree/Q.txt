Is A Binary Search Tree
Question
1. You are given a partially written BinaryTree class.
2. You are required to check if the tree is a Binary Search Tree (BST) as well. In a BST every node has a value greater than all nodes on it's left side and smaller value than all node on it's right side.
3. Input is managed for you. 

Note -> Please refer the question video for clarity.
Input Format
Input is managed for you.
Output Format
true if the tree is a BST, false otherwise
Constraints
